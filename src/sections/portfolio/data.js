Determined to preserve that special memory, I worked on extracting the audio waveform and used my technical expertise to recreate the heartbeat audio. Realizing that many others could benefit from this, I launched a Fiverr gig. Since then, Iâ€™ve helped dozens of clients relive this cherished moment, creating lasting memories for families around the world.",
